Karate Automation Framework Intro
Day 1
---------------------------------

Karate is BDD style automation tool, that can help automate
APIs, UI etc tests.

It is partially one of codeless automation tools.

codeless -> meaning you do not have to write java classes to use this tool and automate tests.

Official documentation: https://github.com/karatelabs/karate

Nowadays , market team sees many job requirements with this tool. So we are having few hours to go over and learn karate.

========================

Automation Tools:
	Licensed:
		- HP QTP/UFT
		- TestComplete from Smartbear
		- Tosca
		- ReadyAPI etc
		.......
	Open Source:
		- Selenium WebDriver
		- Cypress
		- Protractor
		- TestCafe
			-> pre-built framework:
				-> karate
				-> selenide
				-> serenity
				-> neodymium
				etc

pre-built framework -> already includes utilities, support for browsers, reporting, and structure that you can follow.

==================================

karate supports feature files and we do not need to write step definition java classes like in Cucumber.
It supports API test automation, UI , Performance tests.

==================================

How to create a project.

1) we could create empty project and add karate dependency

<dependency>
    <groupId>com.intuit.karate</groupId>
    <artifactId>karate-junit5</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>

However , i will need to add folder structure, maybe some setting files etc.

So, instead we can use MAVEN ARCHETYPE to quickly create our karate project.

MAVEN ARCHETYPE  -> is a pre-built template of the project/skeleton project, it will include, dependencies in pom.xml, some test example, some setting files etc.

We can use below command in COMMAND LINE:

mvn archetype:generate \
-DarchetypeGroupId=com.intuit.karate \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=karate-archetype \
-DarchetypeVersion=1.2.0 \
-DgroupId=com.mycompany \
-DartifactId=myproject

For above to work, we need to have maven installed in our local machine. mvn -version should work.

So if you do not have maven commandline installed , then we can use Intellij IDE for archetype as well.

1) Open intellij IDea

2) File > New > Project

3) Select maven from left side and check 'create from archetype'

4) Click on Add archetype

Group id = com.intuit.karate
Artifact id = karate-archetype
Version = 0.9.4

clone and open below in Intellij

The above is exact result of using karate maven archetype.

===========================================================

In your resume:
	Skills list:
		Automation Tools: Selenium ... Karate

Karate -> I added a smoke test for one of our REST API applications

===========================================================

if below error happens:
Cannot invoke "javax.script.ScriptEngine.createBindings()" because "com.intuit.karate.ScriptBindings.NASHORN" is null

Use higher java version.
and use
<karate.version>1.2.0</karate.version>

===========================================================

When using karate , we add feature files under src/test/java
and not under src/test/resources like in cucumber

hello.feature under examples

===========================================================
Test Data:

We can add test data to karate-config.js file using key:value format:

  var config = {
    env: env,
	hello_world_api_url: 'https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/hello-world'
  }

-------------

Karate Keywords:

Set url:
	Given url 'https://sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk/hello-world'

Set api method path
   And path '/hello/world'

How to send request using karate:
	When method GET
	When method POST
	When method PUT
	When method DELETE
	...

Verify status code using karate:

	Then status 200

How to verify json response body:
match keyword
we can use response keyword along with the path to the value

{
  "message": "Hello World!"
}

Then match response.message == "Hello World!"

{
  "message": "Hello World!",
  "address": {
  	"city" : "Chicago"
  }
}

Then match response.address.city == "Chicago"
================================================

Verifying headers using karate:
using match and header keywords:
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8

And match header Content-Type == "application/json; charset=UTF-8"

================================================
